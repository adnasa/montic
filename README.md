Meet Montic
================

Montic is a simple drupal theme that is LESS only. 

Things that don't exist in the realm of Montic page.tpl.php
----------------------------------------------------------------

*  Side bars
*  Site name and slogan
*  Primary nor Secondary menu

Why isn't this in drupal.org?
------------------------------
I considered that this theme needs a bit more love before I submit it to drupal.org
